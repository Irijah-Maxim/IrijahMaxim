            <h2 style="color: #baa28c;">Lesson&colon;  <small>Introduction to Computing</small></h2>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first lesson was an introduction to computing. 
                It included <span class="Empasis"><b>What</b></span> it is, <span class="Empasis"><b>When</b></span> it likely had started, <span class="Empasis"><b>How</b></span> it evolved, and <span class="Empasis"><b>Where</b></span> 
                it can be used. According to Code.org (2020), a computer is a machine that 
                helps us with thinking rather than a machine that helps with manual labor. 
                Computers are tools that are designed to help manipulate information. 
                Computing is defined as anything that involves a computer in some way, 
                be it the creation or use of one. Computers are used in education, business, 
                marketing, the military, healthcare, communication, and so on.</p>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">Generational timeline of computers&colon;
                <ol style="padding-left: 10%;">
                    <li style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">The zero-generation computers, the earliest computers, were mechanical tools that used gears, sticks, or circular rocks (marbles), and they were called calculating machines. A famous example of a zero-generation computer is the Abacus. The abacus is still being used frequently by Middle Eastern and North Asian people to an effective degree.</li>
                    <li style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">The first-generation computers are vacuum tube computers. These computers usually consist of glass or metal-ceramic enclosures to control the flow of electrons and use vacuum tubes as electronic switches. The computers of this generation tend to be very bulky and slow.</li>
                    <li style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Second-generation computers innovated by making use of transistors as switches, which had a switching time of 0.3 microseconds. Transistors have made important developments in all aspects of the computer system design.</li>
                    <li style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Third-generation computers, or the integrated circuit era, were first based on SSI (Small Scale Integration) circuits, which then evolved into MSI (Medium Scale Integration) circuits. IC’s are semiconductors with several transistors built into it, which brought huge gains in computational power. SSI circuits had 10 devices per circuit, and MSI’s had 100 per circuit.  </li>
                    <li style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">The current fourth generation consists of PC (Personal Computer), LSI (Large Scale Integration), and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration). For this generation of computers, entire processing systems have been converted into a single chip and made use of semiconductor memories.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of this lesson is about jobs and careers one can get from computing. Which honestly didn’t interest me that much.</p>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disliked the lessons, as they mostly only talked about the career opportunities one can get from computing and the evolution timeline of computers. History is not hard, but I get really bored when it is discussed, and having to listen about the job opportunities doesn’t really help me as I still lack the skills to be in one. The only part I liked about this lesson was the explanation of what computing is.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #baa28c;">Lesson&colon;  <small>How Computers Work</small></h2>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson this time is about how a computer functions, from how it processes information to the computer systems, the unique numbering systems it uses, and security and vulnerabilities. As this was a lengthy lesson, I shall be simplifying it, or, in other words, highlighting the main parts of this lesson, so that I can remember it more easily.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information processing, the way a computer processes information, is as follows: an input is put in, then it will begin to be processed; as it is processed, it will be stored in storage, then come back to processing; and then once it is processed, it will become an output (input -> process -> storage -> process -> output).</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Computer Systems consist of Hardware, Software, Peopleware, and Dataware. Hardware are all the physical components of the computer; this includes any input and output devices such as the mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor, motherboard, etc., and storage devices like a flash drive, an SDD, or an HDD. Software is the applications you see on the monitor and make use of, such as the operating system and any programs you make use of. Software are electronic instructions that can be written by programmers to make the computer carry out specific tasks. Peopleware are people who make use of computers, such as yourself. Lastly, Dataware is data and information that has been processed so that a human can read, understand, and make use of it. An example of this would be a person's birth certificate.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst not a lesson that was taught to the class, our instructor taught us how to convert letters and characters into different numbering systems... although talking about that will make this log entry longer and more complicated than it actually is supposed to be. Instead, I will only list the numbering systems. The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the numerical representation of characters such as ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘I’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘!’, ‘@’, ‘space’, ‘*‘, and so on; basically, this means that any character on your keyboard can be translated into a numerical value, as computers can only understand numbers and not characters. There are different types of numbering systems that can be understood by the computer: Binary (0 and 1), Decimal (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), Octal (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), and Hexadecimal (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F).</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, a brief lesson about computer security: computer security refers to techniques for ensuring that data stored in a computer cannot be accessed or compromised by those without authorization. The purpose of it is to plan for ways to prevent weaknesses from being exploited. There are three goals in computer security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality is ensuring that computer-related assets can only be accessed by those who are authorized; integrity means assets can be modified by authorized people or limited in a way that is accepted by the authorized party; availability means that assets are accessible by authorized parties at appropriate times. Computer security also includes vulnerabilities in hardware, software, peopleware, and dataware and ways to secure a computer, like installing an anti-virus and making sure you’re using a safe browser.</p>

            <h1 style="color: rgb(138, 111, 82);">Web Development</h1>
            <h2 style="color: #baa28c;">Lesson&colon;  <small>HTML and CSS</small></h2>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been limited to self-learning as of this time as 
                our instructor has been busy with other tasks. <span></span>Me and my peers were given the task 
                of creating a website, hence why this website exists. The .pdf module we were given 
                was just limited to the very basics and the area of coverage by the HTML and its 
                syntax, and the CSS syntax and how it could be inserted in the html. The lack of 
                guidance made learning this very... chaotic in a sense.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) will always start with 
                the <span class="secnd">&LeftAngleBracket;! DOCTYPE html&RightAngleBracket;</span> declaration: this is to 
                define the syntax as an HTML document. HTML tags are required to add content to 
                HTML; they are structured as <span class="secnd">&LeftAngleBracket;tagname&RightAngleBracket;content
                &LeftAngleBracket;/tagname&RightAngleBracket;;</span> "<span class="secnd">&LeftAngleBracket;/tagname&RightAngleBracket;</span>
                " is the closing tag. The four basic tags of HTML syntax are <span class="secnd">&LeftAngleBracket;
                html&RightAngleBracket;</span>, <span class="secnd">&LeftAngleBracket;head&RightAngleBracket;</span>, <span class="secnd">&LeftAngleBracket;
                title&RightAngleBracket;</span>, and <span class="secnd">&LeftAngleBracket;body&RightAngleBracket;</span>, which are 
                all required to make an html document.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a design language for 
                HTML that styles it. In CSS, each element (anything that can be used in 
                <span class="secnd">&LeftAngleBracket;__&RightAngleBracket;</span>) in the HTML document can be modified, 
                from its color, size, area, background, margins, alignment, etc. You can choose 
                which element to stylize by putting it generally (example: 
                p can only be written in CSS as  <span class="secnd">p</span>), class selectors (<span class="secnd">.classname</span>)
                , and id selectors (<span class="secnd">#idname</span>). It can also be grouped up like this: <span class="secnd">#id1, #id2, #id3 
                {  }</span> ||<span class="secnd">.class1, .class2, .class3{  }</span> || <span class="secnd">h1, h2, p{  }</span> ("||" means 'or' in C programming). There are three ways to 
                include CSS in an HTML document: external, internal, and inline. External refers 
                to making a separate document sheet to make the CSS syntax and linking it to the 
                HTML document; internal refers to writing the CSS syntax inside the HTML document; 
                and lastly, inline refers to imbedding the CSS inside the HTML tags.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 5%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having to learn this by myself was the biggest challenge because 
                I tend to get distracted by other things very easily. I found myself getting bored of the 
                learning process of just reading in <span class="green">w3schools</span>, but I had fun coding the website. Due to my 
                lack of focus, whenever I started to feel bored, I start binge-watching and binge-reading 
                whatever I had found interesting at that time.</p>
